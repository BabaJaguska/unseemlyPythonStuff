# # Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

# ### Goal
# In this notebook, you're going to create another GAN using the MNIST dataset. You will implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), a very successful and influential GAN model developed in 2015.
# 
# *Note: [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v1.pdf) is the paper if you are interested! It might look dense now, but soon you'll be able to understand many parts of it :)*
# 
# ### Learning Objectives
# 1.   Get hands-on experience making a widely used GAN: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN).
# 2.   Train a powerful generative model.

# 
# Figure: Architectural drawing of a generator from DCGAN from [Radford et al (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v1.pdf).

# ## Getting Started
# 
# #### DCGAN
# Here are the main features of DCGAN (don't worry about memorizing these, you will be guided through the implementation!): 
# 
# <!-- ```
# Architecture guidelines for stable Deep Convolutional GANs
# • Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided
# convolutions (generator).
# • Use BatchNorm in both the generator and the discriminator.
# • Remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures.
# • Use ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh.
# • Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers.
# ``` -->
# 
# 
# *   Use convolutions without any pooling layers
# *   Use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator
# *   Don't use fully connected hidden layers
# *   Use ReLU activation in the generator for all layers except for the output, which uses a Tanh activation.
# *   Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers except for the output, which does not use an activation
# 
# You will begin by importing some useful packages and data that will help you create your GAN. You are also provided a visualizer function to help see the images your GAN will create.

    size per image, plots and prints the images in a uniform grid.

    plt.imshow(image_grid.permute(1, 2, 0).squeeze())
    plt.show()


# ## Generator
# The first component you will make is the generator. You may notice that instead of passing in the image dimension, you will pass the number of image channels to the generator. This is because with DCGAN, you use convolutions which don’t depend on the number of pixels on an image. However, the number of channels is important to determine the size of the filters.
# 
# You will build a generator using 4 layers (3 hidden layers + 1 output layer). As before, you will need to write a function to create a single block for the generator's neural network.
# <!-- From the paper, we know to "[u]se batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator" and "[u]se ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh." --> 
# Since in DCGAN the activation function will be different for the output layer, you will need to check what layer is being created. You are supplied with some tests following the code cell so you can see if you're on the right track!
# 
# At the end of the generator class, you are given a forward pass function that takes in a noise vector and generates an image of the output dimension using your neural network. You are also given a function to create a noise vector. These functions are the same as the ones from the last assignment.

If the discriminator didn't learn to detect this imbalance quickly enough, then the generator could just produce more ones.
