    "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a wealth of patient medical information that can: save valuable time when an emergency arises; eliminate unnecesary treatment and tests; prevent potentially life-threatening mistakes; and, can improve the overall quality of care a patient receives when seeking medical assistance.  Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) wanted to know if the records could be mined to yield early warning signs of patients that may require extra care or an indication of the severity of a patient's illness.  In this lab we have access to the work and results of CHLA's applied use of deep neural networks on EHRs belonging to roughly 5,000 pediatric ICU patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use deep learning techniques to provide medical professionals an analytic framework to predict patient mortality at any time of interest. Such a solution provides essential feedback to clinicians when trying to assess the impact of treatment decisions or raise early warning signs to flag at risk patients in a busy hospital care setting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will use the python library [```pandas```](http://pandas.pydata.org) to manage the dataset provided in [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) format and deep learning library [```Keras```](https://keras.io) to build recurrent neural networks ([RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)).  In particular, this lab will construct a special kind of deep recurrent neural network that is called a long-short term memory network ([LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)). Finally, we will compare the performance of this LSTM approach to standard mortality indices such as PIM2 and PRISM3 as well as contrast alternative solutions using more traditional machine learning methods like logistic regression."

    "Next we define a folder which contains both training and testing datasets stored in HDF5 format. Using this folder we define file paths inputs (X) and their associated labels (y).  [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/) stands for hierarchical data format version number 5.  The HDF format is designed specifically to store and organize large amounts of scientific data and was originally designed by [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications).  Common file extensions include ```.hdf```, ```.hdf5```, or simply ```.h5```.  The HDF format has become very popular and is well maintained.  As a result, HDF5 is a flexible and robust format having API support in most languages and library compatibilty with Windows, OS X and Linux. It is important to note that HDF is a binary format and hence lacks the human readable transparency of text based CSV files.  However, HDF file format is much faster in performance, efficient in storage size, and scales well from small proof of concept ideas to [very large operational projects](https://www.hdfgroup.org/eos_vignette/)."

In a traditional feed-forward network all inputs are considered independent.  However, the input to an RNNs also includes the previous output state.  This allows RNNs to model very complex sequences of input and it can be shown that RNNs are, in fact, [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) (see [here](http://binds.cs.umass.edu/papers/1995_Siegelmann_Science.pdf)).\n",

LSTMs do not have vanishing gradient problems.  LSTM is normally augmented by recurrent gates called [forget gates](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/gers02a/gers02a.pdf). As mentioned, a defining feature of the LSTM is that it prevents backpropagated errors from vanishing (or exploding) and instead allow errors to flow backwards through unlimited numbers of \"virtual layers\" unfolded in time. That is, the LSTM can learn \"[very deep](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7828)\" tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands or even millions of discrete time steps ago. Problem-specific LSTM-like topologies can be [evolved](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04277-5_76) and can work even when signals contain long delays or have a mix of low and high frequency components.\n",

    "### Constructing LSTM Network with Keras\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io) is a minimalist but modular neural networks library written in Python.   ```Keras``` is capable of running on top of either the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) frameworks.  Here we are interested in using Theano as it excels at RNNs in general and LSTM in particular.  Note that some frameworks such as [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) do not support RNNs.  Keras was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.  The ```Keras``` library allows for easy and fast prototyping of solutions and supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.  Furthermore, ```Keras``` supports arbitrary connectivity schemes (including multi-input and multi-output training).\n",

    "\n",
    "Both PIM2 and PRISM3 are scoring systems for ICU and surgical patients.  Models that predict the risk of death of groups of patients admitted to intensive care are available for adult, pediatric and neonatal intensive care. By adjusting for differences in severity of illness and diagnosis, these models can be used to compare the standard of care between units and within units over time. They can also be used to compare different methods of organising intensive care. Estimating mortality risk is also an important component of comparing groups of patients in research trials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) was originally developed as a simple model that requires variables collected at the time of admission to intensive care. The original PIM was developed predominantly in Australian units; in the first report only one of the eight units was actually available in the United Kingdom. The PIM2 is a revised mortality index using a more recent data set from 14 intensive care units, eight in Australia, four in the UK, and two in New Zealand. In the analysis for PIM2, 20,787 patient admissions of children less than 16 years of age were included. Since PIM2 estimates mortality risk from data readily available at the time of ICU admission it is therefore suitable for continuous monitoring of the quality of paediatric intensive care. PIM2 uses the first value of each variable measured within the period from the time of first contact to one hour after arrival in the ICU.  If information is missing (e.g. Base Excess is not measured) PIM2 records zero, except for systolic blood pressure, which should be recorded as 120. All consecutive admissions are included.  See [Slater et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12541154) for full details.\n",

    "Similarly, the Pediatric Risk of Mortality ([PRISM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3048900)) score was originally developed around 1988 from the Physiologic Stability Index ([PSI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6728571)) to reduce the number of variables required for pediatric ICU mortality risk assessment, from 34 (in the PSI) to 14 and to obtain an objective weighting of the remaining variables.  Here <a href=\"http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(97)70065-9/abstract\">PRISM3</a> is an updated version of the scoring system published in 1996 which has several improvements over the original model. However, it is only available under licence and is not widely used outside of the United States.  The PRISM3 score has 17 physiologic variables subdivided into 26 ranges. The variables determined most predictive of mortality were minimum systolic blood pressure, abnormal pupillary reflexes, and stupor/coma."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "RNNs provide a method to quickly extract clinically significant information and insights from available EHR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of data, model complexity, number of features, and number of epochs have been reduced in this tutorial to  reduce computational burden.  The examples below display the performance of a fully trained RNN on a larger dataset.  They also show the performance of PIM2 and PRISM3, two standard scoring systems,  as well as the performance of a logistic regression model and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The temporally dynamic nature of the RNN enables it to extract more information from the underlying EHR than an MLP.  The MLP's complexity is similar to the RNN's, but the former is limited to instantaneous information.\n",
