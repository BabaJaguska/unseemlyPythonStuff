# # U-Net

# ### Goals
# In this notebook, you're going to implement a U-Net for a biomedical imaging segmentation task. Specifically, you're going to be labeling neurons, so one might call this a neural neural network! ;) 
# 
# Note that this is not a GAN, generative model, or unsupervised learning task. This is a supervised learning task, so there's only one correct answer (like a classifier!) You will see how this component underlies the Generator component of Pix2Pix in the next notebook this week.
# 
# ### Learning Objectives
# 1.   Implement your own U-Net.
# 2.   Observe your U-Net's performance on a challenging segmentation task.
# 

# ## Getting Started
# You will start by importing libraries, defining a visualization function, and getting the neural dataset that you will be using.
# 
# #### Dataset
# For this notebook, you will be using a dataset of electron microscopy
# images and segmentation data. The information about the dataset you'll be using can be found [here](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/data.html)!

# ## U-Net Architecture
# Now you can build your U-Net from its components. The figure below is from the paper, [*U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), by Ronneberger et al. 2015. It shows the U-Net architecture and how it contracts and then expands.
# 
# <!-- "[i]t consists of a contracting path (left side) and an expansive path (right side)" (Renneberger, 2015) -->
# 
# ![Figure 1 from the paper, U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XgJRexE2CmsetRYyTLA7L8dsEwx7aQZY)
# 
# In other words, images are first fed through many convolutional layers which reduce height and width while increasing the channels, which the authors refer to as the "contracting path." For example, a set of two 2 x 2 convolutions with a stride of 2, will take a 1 x 28 x 28 (channels, height, width) grayscale image and result in a 2 x 14 x 14 representation. The "expanding path" does the opposite, gradually growing the image with fewer and fewer channels.

# ## Contracting Path
# You will first implement the contracting blocks for the contracting path. This path is the encoder section of the U-Net, which has several downsampling steps as part of it. The authors give more detail of the remaining parts in the following paragraph from the paper (Renneberger, 2015):
# 
# >The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated application of two 3 x 3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2 x 2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step we double the number of feature channels.

# ## Expanding Path
# Next, you will implement the expanding blocks for the expanding path. This is the decoding section of U-Net which has several upsampling steps as part of it. In order to do this, you'll also need to write a crop function. This is so you can crop the image from the *contracting path* and concatenate it to the current image on the expanding path—this is to form a skip connection. Again, the details are from the paper (Renneberger, 2015):
# 
# >Every step in the expanding path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2 x 2 convolution (“up-convolution”) that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3 x 3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution.
# 
# <!-- so that the expanding block can resize the input from the contracting block can have the same size as the input from the previous layer -->
# 
# *Fun fact: later models based on this architecture often use padding in the convolutions to prevent the size of the image from changing outside of the upsampling / downsampling steps!*
# 
# <details>
# <summary>
# <font size="3" color="green">
# <b>Optional hint for <code><font size="4">ExpandingBlock</font></code></b>
# </font>
# </summary>
# 
# 1.    The concatenation means the number of channels goes back to being input_channels, so you need to halve it again for the next convolution.
